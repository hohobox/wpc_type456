  @brief This API requests the HSM framework's PBKDF2 Update service
  @details The function does not wait for the HSM to respond. \n
        After calling the function, the user must check the execution result calling the 'HSM_WaitCtxResp()' function of the HSM driver. \n
        The password required as an input of PBKDF2 can be received by user input or can be replaced with a key value stored in the security domain of the HSM framework.  \n
        When Start function is called, if key number is entered as ��0�� the user��s input value is used as a password. \n
        If key number is equal or greater than1, a key value from the HSM domain is used as a password. \n
        If using a key value from the HSM framework as a password, enter NULL for the variable ��password�� and 0 for the variable ��pLen��. \n
        The ��salt�� is a value used to prevent security vulnerabilities such as reuse attacks. \n
        The ��icount�� is the number of iterations of the internal hash function. The larger the number, the longer the computation time is.
  @param[in, out] pbkdf2Ctx     PBKDF2 context
  @param[in] pbkdf2KeyNum       Password key number. USER MUST USE same value pbkdf2KeyNum in Start API
  @param[in] dkLen              Length of key to derive
  @param[in] password           Pointer to the password to be entered from the user (Enter ��NULL�� value if the key value stored in the HSM framework is used as a password)
  @param[in] pLen               Length of the password to be entered (Enter ��0�� value if the key value stored in the HSM framework is used as a password)
  @param[in] salt               Pointer to the input salt (random number) value
  @param[in] sLen               Length of the salt (random number)
  @param[in] icount             Number of internal operation iterations
